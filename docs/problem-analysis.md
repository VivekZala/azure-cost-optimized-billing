# Problem Analysis

## Context

- **Service**: Serverless architecture in Azure.
- **Data Store**: Billing records stored in **Azure Cosmos DB**.
- **Access Pattern**: Read-heavy, but records older than 90 days are rarely accessed.
- **Challenges**:
  - Growing Cosmos DB storage and increasing costs.
  - Need for a solution that reduces storage costs without impacting system performance.

## Pain Points
- **Cost**: High storage costs due to all data residing in Cosmos DB.
- **Inefficient Resource Usage**: Cosmos DB is not optimized for storing rarely accessed (cold) data.
- **Scalability**: As the database grows, costs and performance issues will worsen.

## Constraints
1. **Simplicity and Ease of Implementation**: Solution should be easy to deploy and maintain.
2. **No Data Loss**: Data must not be lost during migration to cold storage.
3. **No Downtime**: Transition should be seamless with no service downtime.
4. **No API Contract Changes**: Existing read/write APIs should remain unchanged.

## **Solution Evaluation**

### 1. **Data Tiering via Cold Storage (Cosmos DB → Blob Storage)**
- **How It Works**: Old records are moved to Blob Storage after 90 days.
- **Pros**: Significant cost savings, keeps API unchanged.
- **Cons**: Slightly higher read latency for cold records.

### 2. **Cosmos DB TTL + Change Feed Archival**
- **How It Works**: TTL deletes records after 90 days, and the Change Feed captures and archives records to Blob.
- **Pros**: Automated, low overhead.
- **Cons**: Requires monitoring to ensure no data loss.

### 3. **Cosmos DB Analytical Store**
- **How It Works**: Cold data is moved to an analytical store.
- **Pros**: Built-in solution for Cosmos DB.
- **Cons**: Doesn't solve cold storage cost issue.

### 4. **Metadata Indexing with Blob Redirects**
- **How It Works**: Metadata is stored in Cosmos DB, and full records are stored in Blob Storage.
- **Pros**: Reduces Cosmos DB storage size.
- **Cons**: Requires careful metadata management.

### 5. **Partitioning Strategy and Compression in Cosmos DB**
- **How It Works**: Records are partitioned and compressed to reduce storage footprint.
- **Pros**: Helps with scaling and RU management.
- **Cons**: Doesn’t solve the cold data problem.
